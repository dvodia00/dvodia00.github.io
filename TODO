- Discuss:
  - I’m using “doctor” and “family doctor” instead of “physician” because even though “physician” has a different meaning in countries where “general practitioner” is more commonly used.
  - Is “Psychotherapeutische Behandlung” a common phrase in German? In English, the shorter synonym “Psychotherapy” is pretty much always used. In English, using the word “treatment” also might feel a bit too “medical” or “clinical”, how is that in German?
  - Is “resources” a common English word in this usage (“a person of resource”). Should we use a synonym such as “capabilities”?
  - Maybe it’s nicer to use “oder” and “und” instead of a forward slash in the German version?
  - Should we be using “relative” or “family member”?
  - In the English version, the last part of the section with the “Ablauf” heading has been combined with the section with the “Ziele” header. Maybe it’s nice to do the same in the German version?

- Add personal introduction with inner links.
  - Use “couple’s counseling”?
- Improve headings.
  - When can Psychotherapy help?
  - How do we get started with Psychotherapy?
- Change to an active voice.
- Fix remaining style issues.
  - “Psychotherapy provides you with a safe environment to…”
