<h2>Psychotherapy</h2>

<p>Psychotherapy provides you with a safe environment to deal with past experiences and to work on current issues. This makes further personal growth possible and allows you to learn how to cope with things you’ve experienced as well as how to get a handle on the structure of your personality.</p>

<h3>In what situation is psychotherapy helpful?</h3>

<ul>
<li>You feel different than usual and therefore insecure.</li>
<li>You often feel down, sad, or hopeless.</li>
<li>You are in a difficult time in your life.</li>
<li>You’ve lost interest in and no longer enjoy things you really liked to do.</li>
<li>You find yourself in situations where you behave or react to other people differently than you would prefer to.</li>
<li>You always repeat the same behavior or you have the same thoughts over and over again, and this interferes with your daily life.</li>
<li>You always have the same conflicts with your partner.</li>
<li>You feel stuck in your current situation and you don’t see any way forward.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>In our first meeting we will discuss your goals and what I can do to help you achieve these. We will start with a diagnostic phase once you’ve decided to pursue therapy. In this phase, we will analyze your specific situation and review your current way of living. Then we will develop an initial support structure for your daily life, after which we will begin working on long-term solutions.</p>

<p>Overall, your thinking and behavior patterns will be identified and gradually changed. Your existing capabilities will be identified and strengthened.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-centered_therapy">Person-centered Talk therapy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_therapy">Schema therapy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_therapy">Integrative Gestalt therapy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_cognitive_therapy">Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Conditions</h3>

<p>With supplementary coverage, your health insurance will pay part of “psychological psychotherapy”. However, be aware that terms and conditions vary between insurance policies. Please contact your health insurance to inquire up to what amount it will cover the costs, and under what conditions (for example, a referral from your family doctor). I am happy to provide a letter confirming my status as an accredited psychotherapist.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you are of course also welcome to pay the costs out­-of-­pocket. In this case, we will be able to discuss the conditions individually.</p>

<p>Please do not hesitate to email me at <a href="mailto:praxis@dvorsky.ch">praxis@dvorsky.ch</a> or call me on <a href="tel:+41445851501">+41 44 585 15 01</a>. An informal conversation free of any obligation is the best way to determine how I might be able to help.</p>

<h2>Life Coaching and Business Coaching</h2>

<p>Coaching is the process in which a suitable companion supports you in the development of your potential that goes beyond a short-term approach. It’s not just a matter of finding immediate solutions in a specific situation, but above all the ongoing work on a sustainable growth process. Both individuals as well as teams can learn how these processes can empower them.</p>

<p>Life coaching is for people who want to achieve specific personal and business goals and who are looking for a better quality ­of ­life. Many people are looking for a different and more personal direction in life. You want to live a meaningful life and are looking for a competent companion to help you resolve important life questions.</p>

<p>Business coaching supports individuals or employers who want to accomplish new work related goals. </p>

<p>You can of course hire me to provide coaching for yourself. It is also possible for an employer to book coaching for managers, teams, or for individual employees.</p>

<h3>In what situations is life coaching helpful?</h3>

<p>Life coaching can help you when you ask yourself one or more of the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are my goals in life?</li>
<li>What is really important to me?</li>
<li>Is my life how I want it to be?</li>
<li>What would I like to start doing next?</li>
<li>Is my life now how I really want it to be?</li>
<li>How can I make my life the way I want it to be?</li>
<li>What is my innermost desire?</li>
</ul>

<h3>In what situations can you benefit from business coaching?</h3>

<p>You will benefit from business coaching when one or more of the following statements apply to you:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are not able to define or achieve your professional goals.</li>
<li>Communication with your manager or with your employees is difficult in your team.</li>
<li>You need tools to make communication more constructive.</li>
<li>You are planning your next career move.</li>
<li>You have a difficult conversation or a difficult phase in front of you.</li>
<li>You want to position yourself on a new team.</li>
<li>You recently assumed a new management position, or you took over a new team.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>Together, we will review and analyze your current situation. Then we will work out what forms of support you might need. We will formulate a strategy, plan the time needed in your schedule, and organize the next steps you need to take to achieve your goals.</p>

<h3>Conditions</h3>

<p>The costs can be covered by the employer or by the client directly. Both employers as well as clients can contact me to schedule an appointment.</p>

<p>Please do not hesitate to email me at <a href="mailto:praxis@dvorsky.ch">praxis@dvorsky.ch</a> or call me on <a href="tel:+41445851501">+41 44 585 15 01</a>. An informal conversation free of any obligation is the best way to determine how I might be able to help.</p>

<h2>Neuropsychological Evaluation and Psychological Testing</h2>

<h3>Indications</h3>

<ul>
<li>It’s suddenly harder for you to concentrate.</li>
<li>You can no longer maintain your attention very well.</li>
<li>It’s noticeably harder for you to remember things.</li>
<li>Your performance at work is lower than it used to be.</li>
<li>Academic performance is lagging behind.</li>
<li>There are learning difficulties.</li>
</ul>

<p>There can be different causes for changes or deficits in concentration, attention, and memory. It is important to first determine whether performance issues can be identified objectively. Only then can a strategy to resolve these issues be devised.</p>

<p>Either you’ve noticed these changes yourself, or people around you have pointed this out to you more than once. Both can be indications for a change in perception and thinking.</p>

<p>Because other people’s perception can be crucial in these cases, family members are often the first to contact a specialist.</p>

<p>If you are unsure whether or not there’s an indication for testing, you can first contact a doctor you trust. Your doctor will be able to refer you to me if needed. You can also contact me directly and we can discuss your situation free of any obligation.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>After you have explained your current problems (or the problems of a family member) in detail, we will plan a session where I’ll administer the appropriate tests. Usually, a test session like this will last about two to three hours and consists mostly of cognitive tasks administered with paper­-and-­pencil or on a computer.</p>

<p>After the test session, I will analyze the results and prepare a report. We’ll have another meeting where we’ll discuss the results and my recommendation in detail. Because it’s important to implement the recommendations in a timely manner, I will also discuss these findings with the referring doctor.</p>

<h3>Conditions</h3>

<p>Neuropsychological evaluation and psychological testing are paid for by your health insurance when you’ve been referred by your family doctor. However, be aware that terms and conditions vary between insurance policies.</p>

<p>Alternatively, You  are of course also welcome to pay for these services yourself. </p>

<p>Please do not hesitate to email me at <a href="mailto:praxis@dvorsky.ch">praxis@dvorsky.ch</a> or call me on <a href="tel:+41445851501">+41 44 585 15 01</a>. An informal conversation free of any obligation is the best way to determine how I might be able to help.</p>
