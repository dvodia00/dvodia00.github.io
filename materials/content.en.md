## Psychotherapeutic treatment

Psychotherapy gives you the chance to work on your issues in a safe environment. It gives you the possibility to look at things that happened in the past and/or are unsettling in the present. It can allow you to grow and to learn how to cope with your own personality structures.

### Potential initial situations

- You feel changed and therefore insecure.
- You often feel down, sad or hopeless.
- You find yourself in a difficult life situation.
- You feel lethargic and lost interest in things you usually like.
- You suffer because you repeatedly behave differently than you would like to. You overreact in situations you’d expect yourself to react suitably.
- Your find repeatedly the same patterns in yourself you’d wish to overcome.
- You are having the same conflicts with your partner over and over again.
- You feel like being in a dead­-end.

### Procedure

In our first meeting we will discuss your goals and how I can help you to achieve them. If you decide to pursue psychotherapy, the next step will be a diagnostic phase, in which we analyse your situation and your current way of living. We will then work out the first supporting structures for daily life and begin to work on long term solutions.

On the whole your individual thinking and behavior patterns will be identified and your existing resources will be identified and consolidated.

### Methods

- talk therapy
- Schematherapy (verlinken mit Wikipedia)
- integrative Gestalttherapy (verlinken mit Wikipedia)

### Conditions

If you have specific complimentary insurance in addition to your health insurance, the health insurance will pay a part of the so called “psychological psychotherapy”. But the terms and conditions vary across policies. Please contact your health insurance company to determine what amount it will pay. I am happy to provide a letter confirming my status as a “psychological psychotherapist.”

Alternatively, you are of course also welcome to pay the costs entirely out­-of-­pocket. In that case we will be able to discuss the conditions individually.

## Life Coaching / Business Coaching

Coaching is a process of inner potential evolvement assisted by a capable attendant. It addresses both quick solutions and sustainable growth processes. Individuals as well as teams are able to learn to enable themselves steadily for working on those processes.

Life Coaching is for people who want to achieve personal and business goals and who want to have a better quality-­of-­life. Many people are looking for a new orientation and meaning in life and are looking for competent partners to help achieve these goals

Business Coaching helps individuals or employers achieve goals in business settings. 

It is possible for an employee to book a coaching for him­/herself. It is of course also possible for an employer to book a coaching for their line managers, for single employees or teams.

### Potential initial situations

#### Typically, your questions are:

- What are my goals in life?
- What is really important to me?
- Is my life how I want it to be?
- How can I make my life the way I want it to be?
- What is my deepest wish?

→ In this case I recommend a Life Coaching.

#### Or alternatively, these are the issues that concern you most:

- You are not able to define nor achieve your job­-related goals.
- The communication in your team, with your boss or with your employees is difficult.
- You need tools for a constructive communication.
- You are planning your next career step.
- You are in a difficult phase of your career.
- You are new on a team and would like to take your position.
- You recently took over a new team.

→ In this case I suggest a Business Coaching.

### Procedure

We will analyze your current situation deeply. Then we will work out what forms of support you might need. We will formulate a strategy and plan and organize the next steps to achieve your goals.

### Conditions

Usually the costs are paid by the company, but of course only if the employer suggested the coaching. If this is not the case, you will have to pay by out­-of-­pocket.

Employers as well as employees are able to schedule an appointment.

## Neuropsychological Testing / Psychological Performance Tests

### Indications

- Your concentration has been much weaker lately.
- You have difficulty paying attention.
- You have noticed a change in your memory.
- Your performance at work slowed dow.

### for students (from 16 years of age):

- There are performance problems.
- There are problems in learning and memory.

The causes for changes or deficits in concentration, attention and memory may vary. It is very important to determine first whether the deficits in these domains show objective decline. If such deficits are established objectively, the next step would be to find solution strategies.

If you feel insecure please first contact your physician of your trust. Your physician is able to make the referral if needed. Alternatively you can also call me and we’ll discuss your case.

### Procedure

After having explained your current cognitive problems or the problems of a relative, an appropriate testing session will be prepared. The testing session lasts about two to three hours. It consists of tests of various thinking abilities administered via paper­-and-­pencil or on a computer.

After the testing the results will be analyzed and a report will be provided. The results will be discussed with the referring physician. Ideally another meeting will take place in which all the results will be explained and the suggestions will be discussed with you.

### Conditions

Neuropsychological as well as psychological performance testing are paid by your health insurance if referred by a physician. General conditions of the health insurance apply (franchise and participation).
